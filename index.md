# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/Aakritipoudel/Linear-regression/blob/main/LR_proj.ipynb)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in **94% accuracy**.


- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Fraud Call Detection using Decision Trees](https://github.com/Aakritipoudel/fraud_detection/blob/main/DT%26Ensemple_Proj.ipynb)

<img src="images/Scams.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Pyhton, Pandas, Matplotlib, Decision Trees

**Project Objective:** Prediction of fraud calls to help users undedrstand and ignore the calls that are not required or are scams.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict **93%** of the calls as fraud or not accurately.

- Used decision trees to check if a call is fraud.
- Classified and predicted what might be a fraud call so it can be ignored.
- Used Decision Tree classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve.
- Explored a machine learning approach to industrial analysis.

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/Aakritipoudel/Orthopedic-Classification/blob/main/KNN_nb_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>


**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Classifying Biomechanical Features of Orthopedic Patients based on provided Features to decrease the time required for finding a diagonasis

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in **80% accuracy** using K-means algorithm
- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
